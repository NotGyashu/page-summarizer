# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a tool maintained by Facebook. It provides a pre-configured setup for developing modern React applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It optimizes React for best performance and includes minification.
The app is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation.**

Ejects the app from Create React App's build dependency.
Copies configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
This command allows full customization of build tools though it's irreversible.
